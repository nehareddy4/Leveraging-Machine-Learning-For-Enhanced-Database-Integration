 My research paper titled “Leveraging Machine Learning for Enhanced Database Integration” was presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Engineering (ICMLDE2023), held from November 23-24, 2023, at the School of Computer Science, UPES, Dehradun, India.
The research aims to tackle the challenge of matching schemas across diverse databases. It emphasizes using advanced machine learning algorithms, such as Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps, to identify attributes with analogous values and facilitate seamless database integration. It also explores the nuances of one-to-one and one-to-many schema mappings and the methods employed to achieve them.
